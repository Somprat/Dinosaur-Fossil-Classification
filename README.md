# 🦴 Dinosaur Fossil Classification with ResNet50

## Overview

This project explores image classification using ResNet50 through two different approaches:

1. **Training from scratch** (custom implementation in PyTorch)
2. **Transfer learning** (pretrained ResNet50 fine-tuned on custom data)

The goal is to understand both the theoretical foundations of deep convolutional networks and the practical advantages of pretrained models.

---

## Dataset

* ~1400 images of dinosaur fossils
* Manually collected and organized into class folders
* Categories include examples such as:

  * Sauropod
  * Theropod
  * Ornithiscia
  * Marine(Ammonites, Plesiosaurs, Mosasaurs, Trilobites)
  * Unknown (Eggs, Footprints, Leaves, etc.)

> Note: The dataset is relatively small, which significantly impacts model performance when training from scratch.

## Models

### 1. ResNet50 (From Scratch)

* Implemented manually in PyTorch
* Includes residual blocks and skip connections
* Trained entirely on the custom dataset

**Result:**

* Accuracy: 61%

**Challenges:**

* Limited dataset size
* Slower convergence
* Overfitting and generalization issues

---

### 2. ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)

* Pretrained on ImageNet
* Fine-tuned on fossil dataset
* Leveraged learned low-level visual features

**Result:**

* Accuracy: 85%

**Advantages:**

* Faster convergence
* Better generalization
* More robust feature extraction

## Model Comparison

| Model             | Accuracy |
| ----------------- | -------- |
| From Scratch      | 61%      |
| Transfer Learning | 85%      |

### Key Insight

Transfer learning significantly improves performance when working with limited data by reusing features learned from large-scale datasets.

---

## Deployment

The project is deployed as an interactive web application:

* **Frontend:** Gradio
* **Backend:** FastAPI
* **Infrastructure:** AWS ECS Fargate

### Features

* Upload an image of a fossil
* Run inference on both models simultaneously
* Compare predictions side-by-side
